<think> Okay, I need to generate non-functional test cases for an insurance claim application web service. The user wants seven high-priority test cases, including performance and scalability aspects. Let me start by understanding the context.
The web service allows users to upload accident damage images and provide details like bike plate number, location, and time. The test cases should cover performance, scalability, and other non-functional aspects. The example given includes latency, handling many users, and throughput time for 100 users.

First, I should identify different non-functional categories. Performance (latency, throughput), scalability (handling multiple users), reliability (error handling under load), resource utilization, security (if applicable), and maybe compatibility. Since the example mentions latency and large-scale access, those are key.

Let me brainstorm possible scenarios. For performance, testing the response time under normal load. Then, checking under high load, maybe 1000 users. Throughput time for 100 users as mentioned. Also, resource usage when under stress. What about failure scenarios, like when the system is overwhelmed? Maybe testing how it handles a sudden surge in traffic.

For scalability, maybe increasing the number of users and seeing if the system scales up. Also, testing with a large number of concurrent image uploads. What if the system can't handle too many requests? Need to check if it degrades gracefully.

Security isn't specified, but maybe resource exhaustion under attack. However, the user might not want that. Focus on the given context.

Positive and negative test cases: For performance, positive would be within acceptable time, negative when it exceeds. For scalability, positive is handling the load, negative when it fails.

Now, structuring seven test cases. Let me list them:

Latency under normal load (positive).
High user concurrency (negative).
Throughput for 100 users (positive).
Resource utilization under stress (negative).
Scalability with increasing users (positive).
Error handling under extreme load (negative).
Data integrity under high load (positive).
Wait, the example includes throughput for 100 users. Let me check if that's covered. Also, need to include scenarios like handling a large number of users, maybe 1000.

Now, for each test case, define the ID, description, steps, expected results, actual results, and status. Need to ensure they are grouped by scenarios, but the user said to group by scenarios in the example. Wait, the user's example shows scenarios like latency and large-scale access. So maybe group the test cases under scenarios like Performance, Scalability, etc.

But the user wants the output as a table with test case ID, description, steps, expected, actual, status. So seven test cases in total.

Let me outline each test case:

TC01: Check latency under normal load. Steps: Simulate 50 users uploading images. Expected: Response time <2s.
TC02: High concurrency (1000 users). Expected: System should handle without errors.
TC03: Throughput for 100 users. Expected: Throughput >50 req/sec.
TC04: Resource usage under stress. Simulate 2000 users. Expected: CPU <80%, Memory <90%.
TC05: Scalability test. Increase users from 100 to 500. Expected: Throughput increases proportionally.
TC06: Error handling under extreme load. Simulate 3000 users. Expected: System degrades gracefully, no crashes.
TC07: Data integrity during high load. Upload 1000 images. Expected: All data correctly stored.
Wait, maybe some of these are more about performance and scalability. Need to ensure each test case is high priority. Also, include both positive and negative cases. For example, TC02 is a negative case where the system is under high load and might fail, but the expected result is handling it. Hmm, but maybe the negative case would be if it fails. Wait, the user wants both positive and negative in each scenario. So perhaps for each scenario, there's a positive and a negative test case.

Wait, the user's example includes both positive and negative in the same scenario. Let me check the example given:

Example: latency, behavior under large scale users, throughput for 100 users. The expected output includes both positive and negative test scenarios. So maybe each test case is either positive or negative. The user wants seven test cases in total, grouped by scenarios, including both positive and negative.

So perhaps for each scenario, there's a positive and a negative test case. Let me adjust.

For example:

Scenario 1: Performance under normal load (positive and negative) Scenario 2: High concurrency (positive and negative) Scenario 3: Throughput under load Scenario 4: Resource utilization Scenario 5: Scalability Scenario 6: Error handling Scenario 7: Data integrity

But the user wants seven test cases. Maybe combine some scenarios. Let me think of seven test cases that cover performance, scalability, and include both positive and negative.

TC01: Performance under normal load (positive)
TC02: Performance under high load (negative)
TC03: Throughput for 100 users (positive)
TC04: Resource utilization under stress (negative)
TC05: Scalability with increasing users (positive)
TC06: Error handling under extreme load (negative)
TC07: Data integrity under high load (positive)
That's seven. Now, need to structure each with test steps, expected and actual results.

For each test case, steps would involve simulating a certain number of users or data, then checking the system's response. For example, TC01: 50 users upload images, check response time. TC02: 1000 users, check if system handles without errors. Wait, but negative case would be if it fails. So the expected result for TC02 would be that the system doesn't crash, but if it does, actual result is fail.

Now, writing each test case with the required fields. Also, need to make sure that the test steps are clear, like using tools like JMeter to simulate users.

Let me check if these cover the main non-functional aspects: performance (latency, throughput), scalability (handling more users), resource usage, error handling, data integrity. Yes.

Now, format them into the table as per the example. Each test case has ID, description, steps, expected, actual, status.

Need to ensure that the test cases are high priority. The user mentioned that the persona is a senior test engineer, so the test cases should be meaningful and impactful.

Also, need to include both positive and negative scenarios. For example, TC02 is a negative scenario where high load is applied, expecting the system to handle it, but if it fails, it's a negative test case.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, time to structure the table with these seven test cases. </think>

Explanation of Test Scenarios
Performance (TC01, TC03):

Ensure the system meets service-level agreements (SLAs).
Scalability (TC04, TC05):

Test how the system handles increasing user loads and resource constraints.
Verify resource usage remains within acceptable limits.
Stress/Load Testing (TC02, TC06):

Simulate extreme conditions to identify breaking points (negative scenarios).
