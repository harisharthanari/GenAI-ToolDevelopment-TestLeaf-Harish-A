It's about aspects like performance, security, usability, compatibility, scalability, etc., not the actual functionality.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key areas. The user mentioned uploading a damage zone image, adding bike plate number, location, and time. So the web service probably has endpoints for uploading data, handling user input, and storing information.\n\nPerformance testing is crucial. How many users can upload data simultaneously? What's the response time under load? Maybe a test case for high concurrent users. Also, checking response time under normal and peak loads.\n\nSecurity is another big area. The service needs to handle sensitive data, so encryption and authentication are important. Test cases for SSL/TLS encryption, unauthorized access attempts, and SQL injection attempts would make sense.\n\nUsability might not be as obvious for a backend service, but maybe the API should be well-documented and have clear error messages. Testing for clear error responses when invalid data is submitted.\n\nCompatibility testing could involve different file types for the damage zone image. The service should accept common image formats like JPEG or PNG. What if someone uploads a PDF or a corrupted image? That's a negative test case.\n\nScalability: Can the system handle increased data volume? Maybe a test where the number of claims submitted increases over time, checking if the system scales resources accordingly.\n\nError handling is part of reliability. If the server goes down during upload, does it handle the error gracefully? Also, invalid inputs like incorrect bike plate formats should return specific error codes.\n\nFor each of these areas, I need to create test cases with clear steps and expected outcomes. Let me structure them into a table as the user requested. Each test case should have an ID, description, steps, expected and actual results, and status. I'll make sure to cover both positive and negative scenarios.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"non-functional\" test cases. I need to ensure that these are not functional tests. For example, a functional test would be verifying that submitting a claim with correct data is successful. Non-functional tests are about how the system behaves under certain conditions, not if it does the right thing.\n\nSo, performance, security, compatibility, scalability, reliability, error handling, and usability (for APIs, maybe documentation and error messages). Each of these will have their own test cases.\n\nLet me list possible"
