Reason for Image Processability:

The image is processable and readable. The text is clearly visible, and the quality is sufficient for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processing. There are no significant issues with the image that would hinder the extraction of text.

However, note that the image appears to be a CAPTCHA image with the code "4SZXT". The purpose of the image seems to be to verify that the user is human, and the text is intentionally presented in a way that is easy for humans to read but challenging for automated systems.
